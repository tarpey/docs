## Document library

By default media files are hidden from users until you include them somewhere on the site, for example by adding an image or link to a page.

This WordPress theme has a document library feature. This means you can organise files into specific folders and users can automatically view and download the files from the website.

By putting files in a specific 'Private' folder, you can automatically restrict access to unauthenticated users.

To create the document library:

* Create a new page and assign the 'Documents' page template
* Organise media files into the 'Documents' folder structure

For example:

* Documents (folder)
  * Public (folder)
    * Agendas (folder)
      * 1-january-2018.pdf
      * 1-february-2018.pdf
    * Minutes (folder)
      * 1-january-2018.pdf
      * 1-february-2018.pdf
  * Private (folder)
    * Notes (folder)
      * confidential.pdf

!> The document library will only work if you have a 'Documents' folder with 'Public' and 'Private' subfolders. You also need subfolders in the 'Private' and 'Public' folders.

## Pages
