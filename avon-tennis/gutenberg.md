# Gutenberg

As of version 5.0 WordPress has a new default content editor called the **Gutenberg Editor**. The new block editor brings with it a completely different approach to content creation in the form of blocks.

Here's what the old WordPress editor looked like. This editor is now called the **Classic Editor**.

And here's what things look like in the new WordPress block editor, Gutenberg:

Gutenberg replaces the single edit field of the classic WordPress editor with lots of individual “blocks”. Blocks then allow you to build more complex designs than those allowed in the old classic WordPress editor.

## Blocks

A block can be pretty much anything. For example, you can have blocks for:

- Text
- Images
- Videos
- Buttons
- Widgets
- Tables

And more. Developers can also create third-party blocks that you can access via plugins for even more flexibility.

Each block is its own entity that you can manipulate on an individual basis. For example, here's a quick Gutenberg post that contains three blocks; two text blocks and an image block.

You can rearrange blocks by dragging and dropping them:

## Classic Editor

You don't have to use the Gutenberg Editor. If you prefer the classic editor then you can keep using it, but the long term goal is for all WordPress users to adopt the Gutenberg Editor.

To use the the Classic Editor:

- Click **Plugins** in the main menu
- Click **Activate** under the **Classic Editor** plugin

De-activate the **Classic Editor** plugin to return to using the **Gutenberg Editor**
